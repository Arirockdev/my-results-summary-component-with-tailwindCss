# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component

![Design preview for the Results summary component coding challenge](./src/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

  This is a reverted mentor frontend challenge, for this case it is used:

**Html, tailwindCss and JavaScript**

It is the first project I have done with tailwind, I hope you like it.
i used api fetch to write in the dom all data from json archive.
  
thanks

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
